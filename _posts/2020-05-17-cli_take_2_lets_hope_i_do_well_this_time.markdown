So, I just finished my second CLI project. Since I had to switch cohorts, I am actually very excited about this one. This time around, I really felt like I understood everything and that I really made the effort to make a really good project. A weight has been lifted off my shoulders!

My project concerned the video game League of Legends. It is a MOBA (massive online battle arena) game that you play on a team of 5 against another team of 5 like a game of capture the flag. It's actually a game I've been playing for years - but at the same time, I really enjoy playing it. 

Essentially, the gem finds the playable champions as well as the information associated with those champions using an API. Last CLI project, I used a scraper, but I found that using an API was actually much more seamless and helpful. 

You find the champion you want to find out more about, type their name and their information pops up. Pretty basic, BUT it gets you from point A to point B in a quickie!

Overall, I'm pretty happy with this project and I'm hoping there's not many mistakes I need to work on. Here's hoping!
