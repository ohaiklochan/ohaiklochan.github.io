I have to say - this project kicked my butt in terms of understanding my coding skills for the couple months I have been doing this. 

I wrote about a game that I play with my friends called "Apex Legends." Apex Legends is a battle-royale game that consists of 9 (now 11) playable characters of different abilities and skill levels.

What I wanted out of my CLI, had I had more time, was to show their name, backstory, and abilities. I also wanted to pair that with the current popularity stats, win rates, and kill/damage ratio of each character. Unfortunately, time didn't allow me to finish these concepts - So, name and backstory would have to do for now (until I come back to the code and see if things work).

Overall, this was incredibly challenging and I started with a very low level of confidence before starting this project. My confidence level is better, but as a perfectionist, I'd want to start again and really try to understand what I was doing with my code. Hopefully, for future projects, I will be able to understand more and more about what I am able to do and always ask for help when I need to.

On a side note - scraping totally makes sense now!
