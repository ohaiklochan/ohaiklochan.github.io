So, doing this project was actually incredibly infuriating. Not because I didn't understand the code - it was just because I kept running into an error within my application. Sinatra didn't like a certain aspect of my code and kept giving me the 404. error. Ugh! So annoying!

I had to add all of my code that was in one controller to the main controller because Sinatra didn't like that code being in the anime_list controller that I had. 

Ultimately, it worked. Got everything up and running - but overall frustrating.
