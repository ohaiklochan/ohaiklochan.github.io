So, this is the second time I'm doing this mod. Needless to say, I have actually really learned this time, instead of stressing out over and over and over about if what I am doing is correct - etc. 

I decided for this project, I would actually make a game. My other project was fine, but I think I was aiming too high to actually figure out what it was that I was doing. This one is just simple AND it has to do with one of my favorite shows - The Office.

I decided that I would make a game organized by difficulty of quote and who said it (graded by 1, 2, or 3). You input your name and enter the high scores if your score gets high enough! 

I figure that this would be super fun to do and really simple than just using an API for data; not that using and API was hard or confusing, but because of the fact that I wanted to understand Javascript in a different way than just all the things I'm used to. 

So, here's hoping for success in round two! I'm very close to finishing school! Just need to keep trucking!
