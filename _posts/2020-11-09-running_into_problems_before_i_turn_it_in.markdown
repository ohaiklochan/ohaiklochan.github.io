*11:29pm*

This was probably the most challenging project that I've done. I couldn't figure out a certain Type Error:
```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read property 'champions' of undefined
    at mainChamps (index.js:212)
    at index.js:178
		```
		
and I literally have tried everything. I currently am still in the process of figuring it out. I will continue this blog post once I do get it. 

*12:16am*

I am still trying everything and I can't figure it out. Ugh.

*12:38am*

I have re-added my old code. I don't know why. It's not working now. Maybe I'm just super irritated that things aren't working right now. >:(

*1:09am*

My old code works... but it's too late to add the CRUD variations. So, I guess it's back to the new code. I have to figure out why this Type Error Still exists. 

*1:18am*

New error, but it's reading a bit of my code as a function when it's not. This is so confusing. 

*1:39am*

Code is working - just not how I want it to. This is even more frustrating, but at least it's not giving me an error.

*1:40am*

I refreshed the page. I spoke too soon :(

*2:00am*

I'm going to see if everything can work soon. This has been incredibly hard. Hopefully I can figure out a solution soon.
