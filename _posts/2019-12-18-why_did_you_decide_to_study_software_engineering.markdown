The reason why I decided to study software engineering was because of the fact that I really wanted something that was purely my own in terms of learning and understanding. As much as I love my job in the medical field as an athletic trainer, the salary wasn't enough for living rates unfortunately. I wanted something to support myself and my family better than what I have now. I looked up software engineering because of the fact that I've been interested in the coding "arts" since I was a teen doing HTML coding for my old myspace and xanga websites. I think that I would be awesome at this and I can't wait for what the future has to offer! This is another chance - I hope I can do more than what is expected of me!
