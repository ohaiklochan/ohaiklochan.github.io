So I created a bookHub app - it's basically a review/blog application that you can write about your very favorite and least favored books.

I still have a bit of trouble with the log in feature, which, I'm hoping to fix before the assessment - however, this was a very fun app - learning about omniauth - especially for Google!

I swear, I had such a tough time with the omniauth - but once I figured it out (especially for labeling GOOGLE_CLIENT vs GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID; I know... it was THAT simple), it was a breeze.

Hopefully, you'll like this app. It was fun to make.
