So, like, I'm doing a second form of CLI using an API. This is the second time around - starting a project from scratch. I feel like I honestly undertstand how to do it - but it's breaking and I'm really just honestly frustrated. 

My project is about a game that I play, League of Legends. The CLI is what is going to communicate to the user and what my user wants to find out about the various champions of the game. The API is what is going to be consumed by the CLI to help instantiate my objects. Finally, my champions class is filled with objects that can be displayed for the user. 

Currently, I'm having problems with my `binding.pry` which is kind of annoying. I had this problem last time too - hopefully I can get this done before the end of the week. I would like to have this done ASAP. :/
